### Disclaimer
This isn't tax advice! See a tax professional to get your taxes sorted out. (More legit disclaimer pending)

### Summary / tldr
The quick summary is there are no tax regulations that allow you to deduct coding bootcamp tuition from your income. There are a few big reasons why which I will explain below.

### Eligible Educational Institutions
Most tax deductions and credits depend on your education expenses being made at an [eligible educational institution](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/eligible-educational-inst). Unfortunately no coding bootcamp is considered an eligible educational institution at this time. **TODO: add some context to what makes an eligible institution**

I will note that there is a possible exception to this rule in that some colleges/universities are now running their own coding bootcamps. **At the moment I'm assuming I'm writing this document for App Academy graduates, so I won't expand further on this possibility currently**.

### Tax Credits
Tax credits reduce your tax liability directly instead of reducting your taxable income. There are two that apply to education,  these are the American Opportunity Credit and Lifetime Learning Credit. Both depend on you attending an **eligible educational institution**. Since coding bootcamps don't qualify, we won't cover these any further.

### Tuition and Fees Deduction
This deduction allows you to reduce the amount of your total taxable income, thus reducing taxes you would have to pay. Again, this deduction depends on you attending an **eligible education institution**.

### Business Deduction for Work-Related Education
Pending
